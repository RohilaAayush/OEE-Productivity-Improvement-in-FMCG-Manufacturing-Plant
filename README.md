# OEE-Productivity-Improvement-in-FMCG-Manufacturing-Plant

## Project Overview
Comprehensive end-to-end OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) analysis and improvement project for an FMCG biscuit manufacturing plant. This project demonstrates manufacturing analytics expertise through data-driven optimization of production line performance.

## Business Context
- **Industry**: FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) - Biscuit Manufacturing
- **Production Line**: 4 critical machines (Mixer, Filler, Packer, Conveyor)
- **Analysis Period**: 6 months (July - December 2025)
- **Data Volume**: 3,500+ production records
- **Annual Production**: 24+ million units

## Project Deliverables

### 1. Data Generation & Analysis
- **Realistic FMCG production data** with downtime reasons, cycle times, quality metrics
- **OEE calculations** (Availability, Performance, Quality) by machine, shift, and monthly trends
- **Statistical analysis** identifying performance gaps and improvement opportunities

### 2. Loss Analysis
- **Downtime Pareto analysis**: Breakdown (36.5%), Cleaning (31.7%), Minor Stoppage (12.8%)
- **Speed loss analysis**: Filler operating 39.7% below ideal speed
- **Quality loss analysis**: 2.1% defect rate in filling operations

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- **Fishbone analysis**: Man, Machine, Method, Material, Environment factors
- **5 Whys analysis**: Systematic problem-solving approach
- **Structured RCA methodology** for top downtime causes

### 4. Visualizations & Dashboards
- **Comprehensive OEE dashboard** with 9 key visualizations
- **Before/After comparison charts** showing improvement impact
- **Executive-ready presentations** with clear ROI metrics

### 5. Improvement Recommendations
- **FMCG-specific actions** for Availability, Performance, Quality improvements
- **Investment plan**: $750,000 over 12 months
- **Expected outcomes**: 13.4% OEE improvement, $1.6M revenue increase
