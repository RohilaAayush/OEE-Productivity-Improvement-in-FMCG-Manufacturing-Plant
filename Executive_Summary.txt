Project: OEE & Productivity Improvement in FMCG Manufacturing Plant
Date: January 07, 2026
Prepared by: Manufacturing Analytics Consultant

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
------------------
Our biscuit production line operates at 71.8% OEE, resulting in significant productivity losses and 
reduced capacity utilization. The plant faces challenges with equipment breakdowns, inefficient 
changeovers, and quality variations that impact our competitive position in the FMCG market.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
• Current OEE: 71.8% (Industry benchmark: 85%)
• Annual Production: 24.0 million units
• Major Loss Areas:
  - Equipment Breakdowns: 36.5% of total downtime
  - Speed Loss: Filler operating 39.7% below ideal speed
  - Quality Issues: 2.1% defect rate in filling operations
• Financial Impact: $2.1M annual revenue loss due to inefficiencies

ROOT CAUSES
-----------
1. Aging equipment (8+ years) with inadequate preventive maintenance
2. Reactive maintenance approach leading to unplanned breakdowns
3. Inefficient changeover procedures between product variants
4. Inconsistent raw material quality affecting process stability
5. Limited operator training on advanced equipment operation

PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
------------------
Investment: $750,000 over 12 months

1. Predictive Maintenance Program ($150K)
   • Install vibration sensors and condition monitoring
   • Implement CMMS for maintenance scheduling
   • Expected OEE gain: +8.5%

2. SMED Implementation ($75K)
   • Standardize changeover procedures
   • Pre-staged tooling and quick-release mechanisms
   • Expected OEE gain: +4.2%

3. Process Optimization ($185K)
   • Filler speed optimization and conveyor synchronization
   • Automated weight control systems
   • Expected OEE gain: +8.6%

4. Quality Enhancement ($95K)
   • Vision inspection systems
   • Supplier quality programs
   • Expected OEE gain: +3.1%

5. Training & Power Backup ($245K)
   • Operator certification programs
   • UPS systems for critical equipment
   • Expected OEE gain: +5.4%

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
-----------------
• OEE Improvement: 71.8% → 85.2% (+13.4%)
• Production Increase: 3.2 million additional units annually
• Revenue Impact: +$1.6M annually
• ROI: 213% with 6-month payback period
• Quality Improvement: Defect rate reduction from 2.1% to 1.0%

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
------------------------
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Predictive maintenance and training
Phase 2 (Months 4-6): SMED implementation and process optimization
Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Quality enhancement systems
Phase 4 (Months 10-12): Full integration and optimization

RISKS & MITIGATION
------------------
• Technology Integration Risk: Mitigated through vendor partnerships
• Operator Resistance: Addressed via comprehensive training programs
• Production Disruption: Minimized through phased implementation

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
